# New York Restaurants
This is a project where I used the basic concepts of sql to access the data of restaurants in New York and answer queries.

### Notes:
 - SELECT is the clause we use every time we want to query information from a database.
 - AS renames a column or table.
 - DISTINCT return unique values.
 - WHERE is a popular command that lets you filter the results of the query based on conditions that you specify.
 - LIKE and BETWEEN are special operators.
 - AND and OR combines multiple conditions.
 - ORDER BY sorts the result.
 - LIMIT specifies the maximum number of rows that the query will return.
 - CASE creates different outputs.
